# mysql-set-role-leftover

**Class:** Privilege leftover

**MySQL Community Server** `mysqld` `26.7.0` (`06a5c1c`) - Oracle

`SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT rfile` (or `SET ROLE DEFAULT` with no defaults) clears the active-role list, then `checkout_access_maps()` returns without `set_master_access(user->access)`. `CURRENT_ROLE()` is NONE. Static global bits that the role aggregated (FILE, PROCESS, SUPER, ...) stay in `m_master_access`. `check_access` reads that leftover. Lab: leftover FILE writes `INTO OUTFILE` as the mysqld UID.

`SET ROLE NONE` is the path that restores `ACL_USER::access`. Dynamic privileges (SYSTEM_USER) drop. DB-level leftover is already closed (Bug#35386565). Default accounts have no roles.

## What an attacker can do

Hold an account that was granted a role with FILE (or another static global bit). `SET ROLE` that role, then `SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT` it. `CURRENT_ROLE()` reports NONE. `SELECT 'witness' INTO OUTFILE` still writes as the mysqld UID under `secure_file_priv`.

An application that sandboxes with `SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT dangerous_role` or `SET ROLE DEFAULT` and then trusts `CURRENT_ROLE()` still has those static bits. `SET ROLE NONE` actually drops them.

The leftover does not grant FILE the account never held through a role. It fails to drop FILE after deactivation.

## How I found it

Same 26.7.0 hunt as the three client leftovers. Default daemon unpublished Crit/High was empty. ACL / roles still had this empty-role early return.

```c
void Security_context::checkout_access_maps(void) {
  if (m_acl_map != nullptr) {
    get_global_acl_cache()->return_acl_map(m_acl_map);
    m_acl_map = nullptr;
  }
  if (m_active_roles.size() == 0) return;
  // ...
}
```

`activate_role_all` (ALL EXCEPT) and empty `activate_role_default` call that checkout. `activate_role_none` then does `set_master_access(user->access)`.

Wrong turn already recorded: first leftover `SELECT note FROM lab.t INTO OUTFILE` returned 1142 (`db_acl()` cache 0). Constant `SELECT 'witness' INTO OUTFILE` is the FILE oracle.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Image `mysql:26.7.0`. Published `127.0.0.1:18630`. Role `rfile` has FILE. Victim has `GRANT SELECT ON lab.*` and `GRANT rfile`, `file_priv=N`, no default role. Login outfile 1227. `SET ROLE rfile` outfile ok. `SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT rfile` makes `CURRENT_ROLE()` NONE; leftover outfile writes `/var/lib/mysql-files/MYSQL-SET-ROLE-LEFTOVER-WITNESS`. `SET ROLE NONE` is 1227 again.

```text

```

## The fix

When `m_active_roles` is empty, `checkout_access_maps()` should `set_master_access(user->access)` the way `SET ROLE NONE` already does. Empty ALL EXCEPT / DEFAULT should not keep the previous aggregated map.
